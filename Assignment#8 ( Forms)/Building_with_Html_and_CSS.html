    <h2 id="top">What can I build with HTML and CSS?</h2>
    <p>HTML and CSS are the foundation of websites in that they provide structure and styling to a web
        page. With HTML, you can add non-interactive elements such as text and images, and include
        interactive elements such as links, buttons, and videos.
    </p>
    <p>With CSS, you can style web pages. You can also make websites responsive using CSS. This is
        possible with media queries, which were introduced in CSS3.
    </p>
    <p>
        (HTML is on its fifth iteration, so you’ll see it referred to as HTML5, why CSS is on its third — aka
        CSS3.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the addition of media queries, it’s possible to check the width and height of the current
        device, as well as the orientation (landscape or portrait). That means you can make a site mobile
        responsive using just HTML and CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s possible to create animations using CSS by gradually changing an element’s properties. And
        you can even create flashy scrolling effects (known as “parallax(opens in a new tab)“) with CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
        While working on HTML and CSS projects can help you build beautiful websites, for more
        complex sites, you would most likely want to use JavaScript. With JavaScript, you can fetch data
        from a database, handle different states of an application, and easily add interactive elements like a
        slider.
    </p>
    <p>
        That said, there’s still a LOT you can do with HTML and CSS alone. Let’s take a look at some great
        project ideas to try out.

    <h2>7 Best HTML and CSS Projects for Beginners</h2>
    <p>
        If you’re looking to learn HTML and CSS and start making money, here are some great HTML and
        CSS projects to help you refine your skills and even get paid to use them.
    </p>
    <h3>1. BUILD A PORTFOLIO OR SIMPLE PERSONAL WEBSITE</h3>
    <p>
        Use your skills to show off your skills! A simple website is useful for showcasing your projects to
        potential employers and as practice writing markup and creating stylesheets. A website builder
        like WordPress or Squarespace could help you get started — you can even add custom CSS to
        personalize it and challenge your CSS skills.
    </p>
    <p>You can keep the design simple if you want to focus on diving into the markup and styling.</p>
    <h3>2. MAKE YOUR RESUME INTERACTIVE</h3>
    <p>This is for your own brand as well as to sharpen your skills. In the same vein of building your own
        personal website, building an interactive resume is one way to show you know your foundational
        skills while also making your resume fun. This article(opens in a new tab) on dev.to by Alvaro
        Montoro walks you through how to do this from start to finish.</p>
    <h3>3. CREATE AN EMAIL NEWSLETTER</h3>

    <p>
        There are job opportunities focused on email building that require HTML and CSS knowledge. You
        can use an email newsletter service like MailChimp and customize the designs.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Here are some ideas on what emails to create for practice:</u>

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Build an email newsletter to share your journey into tech with lessons you’ve learned and
            projects you’ve built with friends and family
        </li>
        <li>Launch an email newsletter of upcoming events in the area or your favorite local spots</li>

    </ul>
    <p> <u> Here are some roles and freelance email-related jobs to look for:
        </u></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Email designer</li>
        <li>Email developer</li>
        <li>HTML developer</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>4. MAKE A STATIC RESPONSIVE WEBSITE</h3>
    <p>Users come to websites from various devices. This means they’re viewing the content on different
        screen sizes. A responsive website has content formatted according to screen size using CSS media
        queries and HTML. It is important to know how to do this, so take that personal website, portfolio,
        or mock site and make it work across all different viewport sizes.</p>
    <p><u>Here are some ideas of what websites to make for practice:</u></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A web page for a make-believe restaurant</li>
        <li>A biographical page about your favorite author</li>
        <li>A simple marketing landing page for a friend or family member’s business or to display his
            or her personal work</li>
    </ul>
    <p><u>Here are some ideas of what freelance opportunities to look for to create a static responsive website:</u></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A web page for a make-believe restaurant</li>
        <li>A biographical page about your favorite author</li>
        <li>A simple marketing landing page for a friend or family member’s business or to display his
            or her personal work</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is also an opportunity to learn Flexbox(opens in a new tab) to build a grid system that easily
        collapses based on the screen size.</p>

    <h3>5. BUILD A FORM</h3>
    <p>Knowing how to put interactive controls together to build a form is extremely useful in web
        development. You use buttons, inputs, forms, and HTML elements to allow for user input. This is
        also a chance to show your UX and UI skills by making the form accessible, making decisions
        about placeholder helper text, and creating labels for form fields.</p>
    <h3>6. CREATE AN ANIMATION</h3>
    <p>An animation? With just HTML and CSS? Yep, it’s possible! You can put your CSS skills to the test
        by creating shapes and animations to break down data or to make your website feel more
        interactive. For example, you can use an animation when a user hovers over an element.</p>
    <p>Here are some ideas for animations to create:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hover interactions for your personal site to let the user know where they are</li>
        <li>An animation to greet your users</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7. CONTRIBUTE TO AN OPEN SOURCE PROJECT</h3>
    <p>Even with just HTML and CSS skills, you can contribute to an open source project. Open source
        work is a great way to get real world experience while honing your skills. For ideas on how to get
        started, learn more here: What is Open Source? How to Contribute to Your First Open Source
        Project</p>
    <p>You can find open source projects on hosting sites like GitHub(opens in a new tab).</p>
